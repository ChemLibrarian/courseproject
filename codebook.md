This codebook explains the variables in "tidydata.txt" file. 


Experimental design and background: 
=========================================
The background of the research project and experiment design can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones . The README.txt file under the data folder downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip carries additional details of the experiment. 

Raw data: 
=========================================
The raw data is donwloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  and the variables are explained in the README.txt and features_info.txt files under the data folder.


Processed data: 
=========================================
The "tidydata.txt" file contains the data processed by the "run.analysis.R" script from the raw data described above. 

Each row represents the mean of the mean and standard deviation of measurement performed on a particular subject doing a particular activity. For example, the data in the first row and third column means the mean of the tBodyAcc-mean()-X meansured from Subject 1 when Subject 1 was lying.  

The first and the second column listed the Subject and the Activity description of the measured variable. The third to the 81th columns list the means of variables on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
These corresponding mean and standard deviation for measurements are: 

"tBodyAcc-mean()-X"
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"
"tBodyAcc-std()-X"
"tBodyAcc-std()-Y"
